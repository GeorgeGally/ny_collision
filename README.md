There's more than 20 000 motor vehicle accidents in New York every month, leaving a dozen dead and over 2000 injured. <br><br>
That's around an accident every 30 seconds, and one every 600 yards of road. In 10 years, once most vehicles are autonomous, we'll look back at this time as utter madness.

I wanted to take a snapshop of this and use the data and create something beautiful to jutapose these underlying horific statistics. <br>

The twirls represent resonance - that these accidents effect people and families beyond just that moment. However, I also didn't want to trivilize the data, so there's an number of other visualisations included to explore.
